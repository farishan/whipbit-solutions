## Contribution
The easiest way to contribute is to go to assets/all_projects.json, add a new project at the end of the file (following the examples) and create a pull request.

You can create new developer profiles and assets for them (assets/developers.png and assets/all_developers.json). Do it the same way as with adding new projects.

If you're feeling generous, you can go through the code, clean or improve stuff. It's up to you.
If you choose to contribute in any way, you're going to be listed in the contributors list.
